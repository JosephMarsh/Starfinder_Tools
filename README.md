# Starfinder_Tools
This is an application I wrote for a class I took at CWI
IIt’s written in HTML5 and CSS3. It uses a personally customized JQuery UI for some of the visual elements, and some plane JQuery and some
Java Script that I wrote for the logic.  Its primary purpose was to fulfill some project requirements so the contact form doesn’t actually
do anything and the gallery page was a box I had to check off. The real passion and the inspiration for this was the tools page.  It
features two tools that I use for a pen and paper PRG called StarFinder.  It’s a space opera style game created by Paizo.
